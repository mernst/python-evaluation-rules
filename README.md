The Python Evaluation Rules document is available here: [PDF](python-evaluation-rules.pdf).

<!-- This following text is verbatim from the introduction to the document. -->

This document presents step-by-step rules for executing a Python program. A
skilled Python programmer uses these rules to reason about the effects of
Python code. This document will enable you to program more efficiently and
with less confusion.

We wrote this document as a reaction to
the vague English descriptions in many textbooks and websites.
If you have only a fuzzy notion of what Python does, you will struggle to write
correct code, debug incorrect code, and read unfamiliar code.
This document might take some effort to understand on first reading, but
overall it will save you time and avoid frustration.

This document applies to both Python 2 and Python 3.
It does not cover every possible Python expression, but does cover the
most frequently-used ones.

This document was originally written in fall 2011 for use in 
[UW CSE 160](http://tinyurl.com/dataprogramming).
