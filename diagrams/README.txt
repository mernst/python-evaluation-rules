TO MAKE A DIAGRAM
=================

1.  Open a Windows computer with Microsoft Office installed.
2.  Open eval_rules_diagram_templates.pub. This Publisher document contains 
    templates for various Python value diagrams as well as a template for 
    Python frame and environment diagrams. 
3.  Using the templates as a starting point, arrange the templates to build
    whatever diagram you would like. (In order to make frames and environments,
    you will likely have to "ungroup" the constituent components of the frame 
    template so that you can rearrange components within the it.)
4.  When you have finished your diagram, select all of its components, right
    click any of them, and select "Save as Picture". This will produce a PNG
    representation of the diagram.

TODO: Generate the pictures procedurally, such as from a textual description
