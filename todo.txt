TODO
====

Here are several TODO items for the Python Evaluation Rules document, eval_rules.tex :

* Add sections about Python classes and methods.
* revise last 3 sections; they are too long, with poor examples and writing.

* Update sections, such as section 6.2, to give a frame diagram instead of
  "# lst is [1, 2, 3]".

Variable names:
* Go through all examples and use more creative values than ['a', 'b', 'c'] and
  the like.
* change bindings-2 to
    pi 3.14
    greeting "hello world"
    answer 42
    fermat True
